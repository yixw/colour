    calculation of Rayleigh optical depth in the atmosphere. In some
    cases differences among these techniques can be important,
    especially in the UV region of the spectrum and under clean
    atmospheric conditions. The authors recommend that the calculation
    of Rayleigh optical depth be approached by going back to the first
    principles of Rayleigh scattering theory rather than the variety
    of curve- fitting techniques currently in use. A survey of the
    literature was conducted in order to determine the latest values
    of the physical constants necessary and to review the methods
    available for the calculation of Rayleigh optical depth. The
    recommended approach requires the accurate calculation of the
    refractive index of air based on the latest published
    measurements. Calculations estimating Rayleigh optical depth
    should be done as accurately as possible because the inaccuracies
    that arise can equal or even exceed other quantities being
    estimated, such as aerosol optical depth, particularly in the UV
    region of the spectrum. All of the calculations are simple enough
    to be done easily in a spreadsheet.},

  abstract     = {While each of his or her two eyes was independently
    adapted to a different illuminant in viewing a complex visual
    field, each of a number of observers matched a series of test
    colors seen by one eye with a juxtaposed variable stimulus seen by
    the other eye. The 2 degrees test and matching stimuli were
    located centrally in the complex adapting field, which subtended
    an angle of 31 degrees X 24 degrees. In making the matches, the
    observer viewed the test and matching stimuli for a series of
    brief intervals (approximately 1 sec) while viewing the complex
    adapting field with normal eye movements. Nine experiments were
    performed with different pairs of illuminants and different
    illuminances ranging from that of an average living room to that
    of a scene illuminated with hazy sunlight. In three other
    experiments each of the observer's two eyes was adapted to a
    different illuminance of D55. The amount of adaptation was more
    nearly complete at high levels of illuminance than at low levels,
    and the proportional amount of adaptation was less for the "blue"
    receptors. When adaptation coefficients were determined from the
    actual adaptation differences (e.g., from corresponding
    tristimulus values for matching neutrals) rather than from the
    adapting illuminants, a linear von Kries transformation based on
    experimentally determined visual primaries gave corresponding
    chromaticities that were in good agreement with the results
    obtained in each of the chromatic-adaptation experiments, except
    at the lowest illuminances. The results of the experiments in
    which each eye was adapted to different levels of the same
    illuminant indicated again that adaptation to the different levels
    was incomplete, the proportional amount of adaptation being less
    at low illuminances and for the "blue" receptors. This caused a
    change in chromatic adaptation with the level of illuminance even
    when the chromaticities of the adapting lights were equal. The
    results of these experiments also indicated that higher purities
    are needed in order to produce the same absolute color appearances
    at low levels of illuminance.},

    have been used to convert OSA-UCS-based color specification

    inverting OSA-UCS to CIEXYZ values. Thus, numerical algorithms,
    such as the Newton-Raphson method, have been employed to obtain
    the transformations. The relative low accuracy and long
    computation time of this method makes it undesirable for practical
    applications. An artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to
    convert OSA-UCS to CIEXYZ. Its performance was compared with that
    of numerical methods. After optimization, ANN gave a better
    performance with a mean error (DeltaEXYZ) of 1.0x10(-4) and a

  abstract     = {The proliferation of low-cost colour imaging devices
    in the consumer market has led to a greater need to transfer
    images from one medium or device to another without loss of colour
    fidelity. A common solution is to characterise each device in
    terms of its CIE tristimulus values. In this paper two general
    techniques, artificial neural networks and polynomial transforms,
    are compared for their usefulness in characterising colour
    cameras. The neural and polynomial techniques are shown to give
    approximately similar performance once the parameters of the
    models are optimised. Since neural networks can be difficult and
    time-consuming to train, it is concluded that polynomial
    transforms offer the better alternative for camera
    characterisation.},

  abstract     = {The color rendering index (CRI) has been shown to
    have deficiencies when applied to white light-emitting-diode–based
    sources. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the restricted scope
    of the CRI unnecessarily penalizes some light sources with
    desirable color qualities. To solve the problems of the CRI and
    include other dimensions of color quality, the color quality scale
    (CQS) has been developed. Although the CQS uses many of elements
    of the CRI, there are a number of fundamental differences. Like
    the CRI, the CQS is a test-samples method that compares the
    appearance of a set of reflective samples when illuminated by the
    test lamp to their appearance under a reference illuminant. The
    CQS uses a larger set of reflective samples, all of high chroma,
    and combines the color differences of the samples with a root mean
    square. Additionally, the CQS does not penalize light sources for
    causing increases in the chroma of object colors but does penalize
    sources with smaller rendered color gamut areas. The scale of the
    CQS is converted to span 0-100, and the uniform object color space
    and chromatic adaptation transform used in the calculations are
    updated. Supplementary scales have also been developed for expert
    users.},

    representing the color of an object perceived by a human observer.
    For the purposes of unambiguously specifying the color an observer
    sees when looking through an optical filter at a well-defined
    light source, we have found the CIE Color Specification System to
    be the most accurate (for a simple and clear description, see
    [1]). In this article we briefly describe the method to calculate
    the three main parameters that fully specify color in this system:
    luminosity, dominant wavelength, and excitation purity. These
    terms specifically refer to the definitions in the CIE system
    given below, but they have analogies in many other systems. A set
    of more general terms often used to qualitatively describe color
    are: brightness, hue, and saturation (analogous to luminosity,
    dominant wavelength, and excitation purity, respectively). These
    terms (and others) are often used interchangeably. Here we will
    adhere to the official terms assigned to the CIE system to avoid
    any ambiguity.},

  abstract     = {Cameras record three color responses (RGB) which are
    device dependent. Camera coordinates are mapped to a standard
    color space, such as XYZ—useful for color measurement—by amapping
    function, e.g., the simple 3×3 linear transform (usually derived
    through regression). This mapping, which we will refer to as
    linear color correction (LCC), has been demonstrated to work well
    in the number of studies. However, it can map RGBs to XYZs with
    high error. The advantage of the LCC is that it is independent of
    camera exposure. An alternative and potentially more powerful
    method for color correction is polynomial color correction (PCC).
    Here, the R, G,and B values at a pixel are extended by the
    polynomial terms. For a given calibration training set PCC can
    significantly reduce the colorimetric error. However, the PCC fit
    depends on exposure, i.e., as exposure changes the vector of
    polynomial components is altered in a nonlinear way which results
    in hue and saturation shifts. This paper proposes a new
    polynomial-type regression loosely related to the idea of
    fractional polynomials which we call root-PCC (RPCC). Our idea is
    to take each term in a polynomial expansion and take its kth root
    of each k-degree term. It is easy to show terms defined in this
    way scale with exposure. RPCC is a simple (low complexity)
    extension of LCC. The experiments presented in this paper
    demonstrate that RPCC enhances color correction performance on
    real and synthetic data.},

  abstract     = {A visually uniform color coordinate system, based
    upon simple mathematical formulas, is described. This system
    resembles the Adams chromatic-value system but replaces the
    quintic-parabola function with a cube-root function. For colors
    having reflectances greater than 0.5{\%} the color spacing
    obtained agrees with Munsell spacing as closely as the modified
    Adams system. At lower reflectances an expanded color spacing over
    that of the Munsell system is provided. The cube-root equations
    can be solved directly for color coordinate differences in terms
    of simple functions of the difference in colorimeter readings or
    tristimulus values. The computation of color coordinates in this
    system is simpler and requires less computational precision than
    other visually uniform color coordinate systems. A simple slide
    rule for computing color differences in cube-root color
    coordinates is described. A modification of the cube-root color
    coordinate system which provides nearly perfect representation of
    the spacing of Munsell colors is described, and the
    appropriateness of the assumptions required to obtain this
    behavior is discussed.},

    inverse slope of the line that connects it to x and y. With two

    accurate across wide chromaticity and CCT ranges (3000-10(6) K)

  abstract     = {CMCCAT97 is a chromatic adaptation transform
    included in CIECAM97s, the CIE 1997 colour appearance model, for
    describing colour appearance under different viewing conditions
    and is recommended by, the Colour Measurement Committee of the
    Society, of Dyers and Colourists for predicting the degree of
    colour inconstancy, of surface colours. Among the many, transforms
    tested, this transform gave the most accurate predictions to a
    number of experimental data sets. However, the structure of
    CMCCAT97 is considered complicated and causes problems when
    applications require the use of its reverse mode. This article
    describes a simplified version of CMCCAT97-CMCCAT2000-which not
    only, is significantly, simpler and eliminates the problems of
    reversibility, but also gives a more accurate prediction to almost
    all experimental data sets than does the original transform. (C)

    (WCG) content represents a greater range of luminance levels and a

    The current video distribution environments deliver Standard

    desirable to examine if such signal format still works well for
    compression, and to know if the overall system performance can be
    further improved by exploring different signal formats. In this
    paper, ITP (ICTCP) colour space is presented. The paper
    concentrates on examining the two aspects of ITP colour space: 1)
    ITP characteristics in terms of signal quantization at a given bit
    depth; 2) ITP compression performance. The analysis and simulation
    results show that ITP 10 bit has better properties than Y′CbCr⁃PQ
    10bit in colour quantization, constant luminance, hue property and
    chroma subsampling, and it also has good compression efficiency.
    Therefore it is desirable to adopt ITP colour space as a new

  abstract     = {Can a single colour model be used for all
    colorimetric applications? This article intends to answer that
    question. Colour appearance models have been developed to predict
    colour appearance under different viewing conditions. They are
    also capable of evaluating colour differences because of their
    embedded uniform colour spaces. This article first tests the
    performance of the CIE 2002 colour appearance model, CIECAM02, in
    predicting three types of colour discrimination data sets: large-
    and small-magnitude colour differences under daylight illuminants
    and small-magnitude colour differences under illuminant A. The
    results showed that CIECAM02 gave reasonable performance compared
    with the best available formulae and uniform colour spaces. It was
    further extended to give accurate predictions to all types of
    colour discrimination data. The results were very encouraging in
    that the CIECAM02 extensions performed second best among all the
    colour models tested and only slightly poorer than the models that
    were developed to fit a particular data set. One extension derived
    to fit all types of data can predict well for colour differences
    having a large range of difference magnitudes. 2006 Wiley

  abstract     = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides
    to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of
    applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking
    tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking
    program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and
    systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide
    sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the
    poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit
    solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top
    10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA}
    for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with
    default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide
    sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the
    native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the
    recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for
    these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster.
    Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound
    receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of
    peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find
    that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for
    extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges,
    defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

    model's performance was compared with the other spaces and models
    using the LUTCHI Colour Appearance Data Set. The results show that

    colour appearance under a wide range of viewing parameters such as
    light sources, surrounds/media, achromatic backgrounds, sizes of
    stimuli, and luminance levels. It had a similar performance as

    reproduction, gamut mapping, prediction of metamerism and colour
    constancy, and quantification of colour-rendering properties. The

  abstract     = {An apparatus is described which facilitates the
    presentation of pairs of variable colors without variation of
    luminance. With this instrument, various criteria of visual
    sensitivity to color difference have been investigated. The
    standard deviation of color matching was finally adopted as the
    most reproducible criterion. The test field was two degrees in
    diameter, divided by a vertical biprism edge, and was viewed
    centrally with a surrounding field of fortytwo degrees diameter
    uniformly illuminated so as to have a chromaticity similar to that
    of the I.C.I. Standard Illuminant C (average daylight). The
    luminance of the test field was maintained constant at 15
    millilamberts, and the surrounding field was 7.5 millilamberts.
    These fields were viewed monocularly through an artificial pupil,
    2.6 mm in diameter. Over twenty-five thousand trials at color
    matching have been recorded for a single observer, and the
    readings are analyzed in detail and compared with previously
    available data. The standard deviations of the trials are
    represented in terms of distance in the standard 1931 I.C.I.
    chromaticity diagram. These increments of distance are represented
    as functions of position along straight lines in the chromaticity
    diagram, and also as functions of direction of departure from
    points representing certain standard chromaticities. Such
    representations are simpler than the traditional representations
    of wavelength thresholds and purity thresholds as functions of
    wave-length, and the accuracy of the representations is improved
    by this simplicity. Chromaticity discrimination for non-spectral
    colors is represented simultaneously and on the same basis as for
    spectral colors. Small, equally noticeable chromaticity
    differences are represented for all chromaticities and for all
    kinds of variations by the lengths of the radii of a family of
    ellipses drawn on the standard chromaticity diagram. These
    ellipses cannot be transformed into equal-sized circles by any
    projective transformation of the standard chromaticity diagram.
    The consistency of these data with the results of other
    investigators is exhibited in terms of the noticeabilities of
    wave-length differences in the spectrum and of the noticeabilities
    of purity differences from a neutral stimulus, as functions of
    dominant wave-length.},

  abstract     = {Chromatic adaptation transforms are used in imaging
    system to map image appearance to colorimetry under different
    illumination sources. In this paper, the performance of different
    chromatic adaptation transforms (CAT) is compared with the
    performance of transforms based on RGB primaries that have been
    investigated in relation to standard color spaces for digital
    still camera characterization and image interchange. The chromatic
    adaptation transforms studied are von Kries, Bradford, Sharp, and
    CMCCAT2000. The RGB primaries investigated are ROMM, ITU-R BT.709,
    and 'prime wavelength' RGB. The chromatic adaptation model used is
    a von Kries model that linearly scales post-adaptation cone
    response with illuminant dependent coefficients. The transforms
    were evaluated using 16 sets of corresponding color dat. The
    actual and predicted tristimulus values were converted to CIELAB,
    and three different error prediction metrics, (Delta) ELab,
    (Delta) ECIE94, and (Delta) ECMC(1:1) were applied to the results.
    One-tail Student-t tests for matched pairs were calculated to
    compare if the variations in errors are statistically significant.
    For the given corresponding color data sets, the traditional
    chromatic adaptation transforms, Sharp CAT and CMCCAT2000,
    performed best. However, some transforms based on RGB primaries
    also exhibit good chromatic adaptation behavior, leading to the
    conclusion that white-point independent RGB spaces for image
    encoding can be defined. This conclusion holds only if the linear
    von Kries model is considered adequate to predict chromatic
    adaptation behavior.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes the specifications and usage of
    standard RGB color spaces promoted today by standard bodies and/or
    the imaging industry. As in the past, most of the new standard RGB
    color spaces were developed for specific imaging workflow and
    applications. They are used as interchange spaces to communicate
    color and/or as working spaces in imaging applications. Standard
    color spaces can facilitate color communication: if an image is in
    ‘knownRGB,' the user, application, and/or device can unambiguously
    understand the color of the image, and further color manage from
    there if necessary. When applied correctly, a standard RGB space
    can minimize color space conversions in an imaging workflow,
    improve image reproducibility, and facilitate
    accountability.$\backslash$nThe digital image color workflow is
    examined with emphasis on when an RGB color space is appropriate,
    and when to apply color management by profile. An RGB space is
    “standard” because either it is defined in an official standards
    document (a de jure standard) or it is supported by commonly used
    tools (a de facto standard). Examples of standard RGB color spaces
    are ISO RGB, sRGB, ROMM RGB, Adobe RGB 98, Apple RGB, and video
    RGB spaces (NTSC, EBU, ITU-R BT.709). As there is no one RGB color
    space that is suitable for all imaging needs, factors to consider
    when choosing an RGB color space are discussed.},
